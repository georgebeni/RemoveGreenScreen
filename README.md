# RemoveGreenScreen
### The purpose of the application
* The application takes the first image and changes its green background with the second image.
### How to use
* First, you need two images. An image that contains a <em>character</em> (man, car, etc.). The second image must contain a <em>background</em> image (beach, mountains, etc.).
* To insert these images in the application you must use the <strong>Upload Character</strong> and <strong>Upload Background</strong> buttons.
* You will see the pictures in the first two boxes.
* After that, click on <strong>Merge Images</strong> and you will see the result in the third box.
* To save the resulting image to your computer, click <strong>Save Image</strong>. The image will be saved as <strong><em>result.jpg</em></strong> in the <em>Downloads</em> folder (or the main folder where your downloads are saved).
* Click <strong>Reset Images</strong> to delete the images and start again.
